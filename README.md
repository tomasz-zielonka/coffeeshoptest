# Coffeeshop app for technical test purposes.

How to use this:

I used Homestead VM on Vagrant during development, I recommend the same.

In order to run it, edit the .env file so it matches your DB credentials and run "php artisan migrate --seed" (Coffee options such as "Sugar" or "Milk" will be added automatically)
